# BridgeLabz Java Full Stack Training Repository 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **BridgeLabz Java Full Stack Development with Angular, Python, and GenAI program**! 📚
This repo tracks my hands-on progress through the **21-week curriculum**, including prerequisite setups, core programming, OOP, DSA, collections, and beyond.

Code is organized by **branches aligned with weekly modules**, featuring completed assignments from **GCR codebases**, scenario-based problems, and practice submissions. 💻

The structure strictly follows **BridgeLabz guidelines**: daily practices, lab submissions, and problem-solving approaches in **Java**.
All work uses standard tools like **Git Bash, Notepad++, JDK, and Eclipse** 🛠️
